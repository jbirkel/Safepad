BUGS:
- TRC CipherStore.Decrypt is being logged, even entire files
- sometimes all text is highlighted when return from a dialog 
  - e.g. Save As, Cancel
  - enter password, cancel
  - select recent file, get msg box about can't find, choose yes
- hide/show text checkbox doesn't always work in New Password dialog
- While searc dialog is up, Ln X, Col Y on screen do not update.  
  - also: up/down may not work properly depending on Ln/Col when
          dialog was opened. E.g. start at 1,1 -- up searches won't work
          after a couple down searches
- can bring up two Search dialogs.  Second attempt to open should just
  bring existing one to top.
- sometimes the initial size of the window is tiny.  looks like default window min size

Enhancements:
- fade the unlocked icon a bit to give impression of disabled
- Backup system
- Replace (temporarily hidden)

Dones
* show/hide text does not work in Enter Password box
* status bar: column/line number, lock icon for safepad files
* Horiz scrollbar not visible when starting with Wordwrap off
* MRU list?
* settings: window size, wordwrap, font
* when starts with a file open, all text is highlighted (bad)
* enter on New Password screen doesn't press OK button. (Esc should do Cancel, too)
* after Save As, app caption doesn't update
* Sometimes Delete stops working (and disabled on Menu)
  ** removed the feature.  (Let text box handle delete, no menu item needed.)
* won't open files from command line if there are spaces in the name
* open safepad file on startup, but cancel password entry: main form
  is labeled Form1 instead of Untitled.
* on password retry (reshow dlg after bad password):
  * textbox does not have selection
  * does not remember Show text setting
* change default file open type to safepad + txt
* ask to remove recent if not found
* create an App icon adn attach to main form
* added a log file


Not-Dones:
- Recent file list context menu: delete, move to top/bottom
  --- VS doesn't do this.  Maybe context menus of menu items is non-standard?
      Could do this by adding a layer of flyout menus beneath each file name

Notes  
- OS stopped updating jump list 
  --- Path in registry (HKCR\Applications\SafePad.exe\shell\open\command) was
      incorrect.  (Had moved the project.)  After correcting it started working again.
